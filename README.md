DeviceAtlas::API - DeviceAtlas Enterprise API for Perl
=================

Thank you very much to the initial work done by [darkonie](https://github.com/darkonie/Device-atlas-API-in-Perl "Maksym Naboka") for building a good starting point.

This work was done for [Oversee.net](http://www.oversee.net/ "Oversee.net") with use of the [DeviceAtlas Enterprise Liscense](http://deviceatlas.com/resourcecentre/Get+Started/Enterprise+API).

```
perl ./Build.PL
./Build test
./Build install (may require sudo)
```

This will build, test and install the ```DeviceAtlas::API``` perl module.  This will require ```Module::Build```.

This module supports perldoc: ```perldoc DeviceAtlas::API```

Dependencies
--------------
Modules:

```
JSON::XS
```
The use of this API requires a DeviceAtlas Enterprise JSON file that can be obtained with a license.  In order to properly test the API please place a copy of the JSON file in the test data directory as: ```t/data/donotadd.json```

###Usage###
```perl
use DeviceAtlas::API;
my $parser = DeviceAtlas::API->new('path_to_json_file');
```
Cheers!

Module Description

###MAIN METHODS###

####new####

  Initializes a new DeviceAtlas API object an calls ```_init```

####getProperties####

  Given an input User Agent string, parse and traverse the tree to gather all available properties for that User Agent. This is the main function that should be used. Calls ```trim```, ```seekProperties```, ```propertFromId```, ```valueAsTypedFromId```, ```valueFromId```.  This will return a hash refernce with ALL available properties for a given User Agent.

####getTreeFromString####

  Loads the JSON tree from file path.  Called by ```_init``` and results are stored in ```$self->{input}```. Loads tree into ```$self->{tree}```.

####listProperties####

  Returns a hash reference to s list of all available named properties in a tree.
